Question: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Answer: The main advantage of manually choosing when to create a commit is a possibility to make logical changes and savings for the commit with comments what have been changed. Automatically saved versions are an advantage to be saved by a machine when the user sometimes forgets to save his version, but there is no logic in automatically savings and the user won't know about what changes he has done in previous versions.
